        Ideally, this would be the place for him to showcase his many projects and accomplishments.<br>
        As you can see, however, there's absolutely nothing here.  Cameron is currently working on<br>
        a few really cool projects, involving everything from rockets to keyboards to scratchbuilt<br>
        homebrew computers.  These projects are still in the works, though, and aren't quite ready<br>
        for the public eye (or at least that's what Cameron likes to tell himself).  Be sure to check<br>
        back later for some cool and interesting projects!<br><br>
        And hey,<br>
        Thanks for stopping by ðŸ˜Š
