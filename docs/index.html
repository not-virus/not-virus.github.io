        You've reached Cameron Krueger's landing page!

    <div>
        Ideally, this would be the place for him to showcase his many projects and
        accomplishments.  As you can see, however, there's absolutely nothing here.  Cameron
        is currently working on a few really cool projects, involving everything from rockets
        to keyboards to scratchbuilt computers.  These projects are still in the works, though,
        and aren't quite ready for the public eye (or at least that's what Cameron likes to tell
        himself).  Be sure to check back later for some cool and interesting projects!<br><br>
        And hey,<br>
        Thanks for stopping by :)
